# Vue – Code Guidelines

## We use single-file components

Each component lives in a single file, containing:
- its `template` (the DOM structure)
- its `script` (including `props`, `data` and `methods` among other things)
- its `style` (defining the look of the component)

See the [Vue.js docs](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/single-file-components.html) for more details.

Placed in the same folder are also:
- the test file (e.g. `MyComponent.spec.js`)
- the storybook file (e.g. `MyComponent.story.js`)

## We use typed props

Vue.js allows us to define component props either as strings or as objects (with `type` and `default` or `required` values). Always go for the second option!

Also: only (and always!) define a `default` for props that are _not required_.

Why?
- it makes our code more robust – a warning will be shown when passing a wrong prop type
- it clearly defines the component API and tells other developers how to use it

It is as easy as writing:

```
props: {
  title: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  image: {
    type: String,
    default: 'human-connection-logo.png',
  },
}
```

For more complex use cases see the [official Vue.js documentation](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-props.html#Prop-Validation).

## We use shorthands

For better readability we prefer
- `:something` over `v-bind:something`
- `@click` over `v-on:click`
